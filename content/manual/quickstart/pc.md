## Getting started with eSTK.me on PC

### On Windows devices

Insert your eSTK.me into the SIM slot on your PC, set the [ATR Mode](/stk/settings/atr) to **`eUICC`**, you can use Windows built-in LPA to manage eSTK.me.  
If your cellular module does not support it, you can use a PC/SC reader to manage eSTK.me with lpac.
