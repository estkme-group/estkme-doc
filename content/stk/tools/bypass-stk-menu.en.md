## Straight through to the lower STK menu

Some profiles provide their own STK menus, which can be accessed using the tool.

{{% notice style="tip" title="Reliable operation" %}}
1. You are free to try the feature.
2. The result of the operation is reversible, or at least there is a way to restore the previous state.

After clicking on the function:
1. If there is no lower STK menu available, a prompt will pop up and return.
2. If there is an available lower STK menu, it will reconfirm whether it needs to be pass-through and click '! YES !' will show up the lower STK menu.

{{% notice style="note" title="note" %}}
Once the STK menu is pass-through, the end device needs to be restarted once to recover.

{{% notice style="info" title="Tips" %}}
iOS devices need to no-clip out of the STK menu before the new menu is applied.
