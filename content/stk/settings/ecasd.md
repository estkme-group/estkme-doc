## Configure ECASD domain accessibility

ECASD is a special domain. Unlike ISD-R, ECASD holds the most critical certificates and key data of the eUICC.  
Typically, access to the ECASD domain is only required by the manufacturer of the eSE.  

> Options have prefixes represented by "\< \>" or "\<\*\>", where "\<\*\>" indicates the current selection.  

Options available for ECASD mode:

- **Enabled**: The ECASD domain can be accessed normally.
- **Disabled**: **Forbid any access** to ECASD domain.
