## Manage the configuration files currently stored in the SecureElement

After clicking on the Profiles feature, a "Selection Menu" will be displayed for further selecting the profiles you want to manage.

The "Select Menu" page includes 5 "profiles" and a "next" function (if there are more profiles that are not displayed).
Profiles have a prefix represented by the characters < > or <\*>, where the <\*>" prefix represents the currently active profile.

The name of the profile is determined by both the "Nickname" and the "Provider", and when a profile contains a non-empty "Nickname", the "Nickname" will be displayed first, and if the "Nickname" does not exist, the "Provider" information will be displayed.

When you click on a configuration, the details menu of that configuration will be displayed. and related action options.

- [Enable Profile] (./enable)
- [Disable Profile] (./disable)
- [Set Nickname](./nickname)
- [Delete Profile] (./delete)
