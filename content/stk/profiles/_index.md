## Manage profiles stored in eSE via STK

> The STK menu consists of **5 profiles per page** and a 'Next Page' button (if there are more profiles not shown).  
> Profiles have prefixes represented by "\< \>" or "\<\*\>", where "\<\*\>" indicates the current selection.  

The name of a profile is determined by both **"nickname"** and **"provider"**.  
The **"nickname"** will be displayed **first**. If the "nickname" does not exist, the **"provider"** information will be displayed.

When a profile is selected, its detail menu is displayed with these operation options:

- [Enable Profile](/stk/profiles/enable)
- [Disable Profile](/stk/profiles/disable)
- [Set Nickname](/stk/profiles/nickname)
- [Delete Profile](/stk/profiles/delete)
